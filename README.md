Reaction Time is a game that measures reaction time. The game will display a directional symbol, and the player will have to match the direction with joystick input. When the player correctly matches the direction, their score will increase by one. The game will end if they input an incorrect direction or if they do not react within 600 ms. When the game ends, their score is displayed along with their average reaction time.
